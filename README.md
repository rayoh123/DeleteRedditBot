# DeleteRedditBot
This Reddit bot prompts the user for a keyword and then deletes any posts/comments made by the user on his/her Reddit account that contain this word. This bot uses the Reddit API wrappers praw and psaw.

Download both the "script.py" and "details.py" files and put them on the same directory. Then, add your Reddit account's credentials to the "details.py" file. You will need to make a new "app" on your Reddit account and put it's credentials in "details.py" as well. Finally, run "script.py" for the bot to delete all your relevant posts/comments.
